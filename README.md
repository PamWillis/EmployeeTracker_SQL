# Description
    - This project allowed me to create a content management sytem allowing the user to store information into a database. This application included the use of node.js inquirer and MySQL.
    - The Employee Tracker will allow the user to enter all the information necessary to track the employee data to be used in payroll. User is prompted for various information to be entered in to the database. This person is then able to pull information out to be used as needed.
    - The application allows a central database for the company to keep records, code has been written to prevent SQL injection in order to keep the records clean and prevents the database being wiped out.
    - While creating this application I learned how to code MySQL and write the functions needed in order to call these SQL scripts.
